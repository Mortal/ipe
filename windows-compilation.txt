Compiling Ipe under Windows
(contributed by Daniel Beckmann)

You need the following tools and libraries to compile ipe:

- MinGW. 
  From www.mingw.org, install base package into C:/MinGW/.
  Qt requires g++ 4.4, and will not work with the default 4.7 that you
  will get if you install g++ from the MinGW install tool,
  so you need to download 'gcc-full-4.4.0-mingw32-bin-2.tar.lzma'
  and unpack it into C:/MinGW as well.
  Open a MinGW Shell and say "g++ --version" to check that you have
  g++ 4.4 available. 


- QT. 
  From qt-project.org/downloads, 
  install qt-win-opensource-4.8.4-mingw
  into E:/Qt/4.8.4/  (or edit "common.mak" later)
  (The Qt installation will complain if your Win32 API is not equal to
  3.13.  It seems that ignoring this and using the Win32 API 3.17 that
  comes with MinGW works fine.)
  

- Cairo, Freetype2, zlib, etc.
  Precompiled binaries can be found at 
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/

  I used:

  cairo_1.10.2-2_win32.zip  
  cairo-dev_1.10.2-2_win32.zip

  freetype_2.4.4-1_win32.zip
  freetype-dev_2.4.4-1_win32.zip

  zlib_1.2.5-2_win32.zip
  zlib-dev_1.2.5-2_win32.zip

  fontconfig_2.8.0-2_win32.zip
  expat_2.1.0-1_win32.zip
  libpng_1.4.12-1_win32.zip

  Extract all into E:/IpeDeps  (or edit "common.mak" later)
  
- Lua language
  Precompiled binaries can be found at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/

  I used: lua-5.2.1_Win32_dllw4_lib.zip
  extracted in E:/IpeDeps/lua52


If you have used directories different from E:/Qt/4.8.4/ and 
E:/IpeDeps, edit "common.mak" and change the setting of QTHOME and
IPEDEPS in the "Compiling with MinGW32 under Windows" section.


Open MinGWShell, navigate into ipe-7.x.x/src folder and say "make"

All files should be compiled in ipe-7.x.x/mingw/bin folder
