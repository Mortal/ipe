<h2>12.1 Command line options</h2>

<h4><a name="id1">Ipe command line options</a></h4>
<p>Ipe supports the following command line options:
<dl><dt><b><code>-sheet</code> <em>style sheet name</em></b><dd>
  Adds the designated style sheet to any newly created documents.
<dt><b><code>-show-configuration</code></b><dd>
  With this option, Ipe will display the current configuration options
  on stdout, and terminate.
</dl>
In addition, you can specify the name of an Ipe file to open on the
command line.  Ipe also understands all options supported by the
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.5/qapplication.html#QApplication">Qt
  library</a>.

<h4><a name="id2">Ipeview: a minimal Ipe viewer</a></h4>
<p>Ipeview allows you to quickly view an Ipe file without starting the
Ipe program. 

<h4><a name="id3">Ipetoipe: converting Ipe file formats</a></h4>
<p>The auxiliary program <em>ipetoipe</em> converts between the different
Ipe file formats:
<pre>
  ipetoipe ( -xml | -pdf | -eps ) { &lt;options&gt; } infile [ outfile ]
</pre>
The first argument determines the format of the output file.  If no
output filename is provided, Ipe will try to guess it by appending one
of the extensions "ipe", "pdf", or "eps" to the input file's
basename. 
<p>For example, the command line syntax
<pre>
  ipetoipe -pdf figure1.eps
</pre>
converts <i>figure1.eps</i> to <i>figure1.pdf</i>.
<p>Ipetoipe understands the following options:
<dl><dt><b><code>-export</code></b><dd> No Ipe markup is included in the resulting
  output file.  Ipe will not be able to open a file created that way,
  so make sure you keep your original!
<dt><b><code>-markedview</code></b><dd> (PDF only) <br />Only the marked views of
  marked Ipe pages will be created in PDF format.  If all views of a
  marked page are unmarked, the last view is exported. This is
  convenient to make handouts for slides.
<dt><b><code>-pages</code> from-to</b><dd> (PDF only) <br />Restrict exporting to PDF to this page range.  This implies  the
  <code>-export</code> option.
<dt><b><code>-view</code> page-view</b><dd> Only export this single view from the  document.   This  implies
  the <code>-export</code> option.
<dt><b><code>-runlatex</code></b><dd>
  Run  Latex even for XML output. This has the effect of including
  the dimensions of each text object in the XML file.
<dt><b><code>-nocolor</code></b><dd>
  Do not use any color commands in  Postscript  output.   This  is
  useful  if  you are preparing a manuscript for publication where
  the publisher checks that the figures are grayscale only.   Note
  that  this  option  doesn't actually verify that the figure con-
  tains no color (a figure using color processed with this  option
  will cause a Postscript error when displayed).
<dt><b><code>-nozip</code></b><dd> 
  Do not compress streams in PDF or Postscript output.
</dl>

<h4><a name="id4">Iperender: converting to a bitmap or SVG art</a></h4>
<p>The program <em>iperender</em> converts a page of the document to a
bitmap in PNG format or to scalable vector graphics in SVG format.
(Of course the result contains no Ipe markup, so make sure you keep
your original.)  For instance, the following command line
<pre>
  iperender -png -page 3 -resolution 150 presentation.pdf pres3.png
</pre>
converts page&nbsp;3 of the Ipe document <code>presentation.pdf</code> to a
bitmap, with resolution <i>150</i> pixels per inch.

<h4><a name="id5">Ipeextract: extract XML stream from Ipe PDF or EPS file</a></h4>
<p>Ipeextract extracts the XML stream from a PDF or EPS file and saves it
in a file.  It will work even if Ipe cannot actually parse the file,
so you can use this tool to debug problems where Ipe fails to open
your document.
<pre>
ipeextract infile [ outfile ]
</pre>
If not provided, the outfile is guessed by appending "xml" to the
infile's basename.

<h4><a name="id6">Ipe6upgrade: convert Ipe&nbsp;6 files to Ipe&nbsp;7 file format</a></h4>
<p>Ipe6upgrade takes as input a file created by any version of Ipe&nbsp;6, and
saves in the format of Ipe&nbsp;7.0.0.
<pre>
ipe6upgrade infile [ outfile ]
</pre>
If not provided, the outfile is guessed by adding the extension
"ipe" to the infile's basename.

<h4><a name="id7">Ipescript: running Ipe scripts</a></h4>
<p>Ipescript runs an Ipe script written in the Lua language with bindings
for the Ipe objects, such as the script "update-master".  Ipescript
automatically finds the script in Ipe's script directories.  On Unix,
you can place your own scripts in <i>&#36;HOME/.ipe/scripts</i>.
<p>The Ipe distribution contains the following scripts:
<ul><li><i>update-master</i>, explained 
  <a href="manual_35.html">earlier</a>;
<li><i>add-style</i> to add a stylesheet to Ipe figures;
<li><i>update-styles</i> to update the stylesheets in Ipe figures
  (in the same way that Ipe does it using the "Update stylesheets"
  function). 
</ul>

<h4><a name="id8">Svgtoipe: Importing SVG figures</a></h4>

<p>The auxiliary program <em>svgtoipe</em> converts an SVG figure to Ipe
format. It cannot handle all SVG features (many SVG features are not
supported by Ipe anyway), but it works for gradients.
<p><em>svgtoipe</em> is not part of the Ipe source distribution. You can
download it separately.

<h4><a name="id9">Pdftoipe: Importing Postscript and PDF</a></h4>

<p>You can convert arbitrary Postscript or PDF files into Ipe documents,
making them editable.  The auxiliary program <em>pdftoipe</em> converts
(pages from) a PDF file into an Ipe XML-file. (If your source is
Postscript, you have to first convert it to PDF using Acrobat
Distiller or <i>ps2pdf</i>.)  Once converted to XML, the file can be
opened from Ipe as usual.
<p>The conversion process should handle any graphics in the PDF file
fine, but doesn't do very well on text--Ipe's text model is just too
different.
<p><em>pdftoipe</em> is not part of the Ipe source distribution. You can
download and build it separately.

<h4><a name="id10">Ipe5toxml: convert Ipe&nbsp;5 files to Ipe&nbsp;6 file format</a></h4>
<p>If you still have figures that were created with Ipe&nbsp;5, you can use
<em>ipe5toxml</em> to convert them to Ipe&nbsp;6 format.  You can then use
<em>ipe6upgrade</em> to convert them to Ipe&nbsp;7 format.
<p><em>ipe5toxml</em> is not part of the Ipe distribution, but available as
a separate download.

<h4><a name="id11">Figtoipe: Importing FIG figures</a></h4>

<p>The auxiliary program <em>figtoipe</em> converts a figure in FIG format
into an Ipe XML-file.  This is useful if you used to make figures with
Xfig before discovering Ipe, of if your co-authors made figures for
your article with Xfig (converting them will have the added benefit of
forcing your co-authors to learn to use Ipe).  Finally, there are
quite a number of programs that can export to FIG format, and
<em>figtoipe</em> effectively turns that into the possibility of
exporting to Ipe.
<p>However, <em>figtoipe</em> is not quite complete.  The drawing models of
FIG and Ipe are also somewhat different, which makes it impossible to
properly render some FIG files in Ipe.  Ipe does not support depth
ordering independent of grouping, pattern fill, and Postscript fonts.
You may therefore have to edit the file after conversion.
<p><em>figtoipe</em> is not part of the Ipe distribution. You can download
and build it separately. <em>figtoipe</em> is now maintained by
Alexander B&uuml;rger.
