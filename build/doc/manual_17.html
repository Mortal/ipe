<h2>4.2 Text objects</h2>

<p>


 
Text objects come in two flavors: simple <em>labels</em>, and
<em>minipages</em>.  There are two variants of these: <em>titles</em> (a
label that serves as the title of the page), and <em>textbox</em> (a
minipage that spans the entire width of the page).
<p>The position you have to click to start creating a <em>label</em> object
is normally the leftmost baseline point (but this can be changed by
changing the object's horizontal and vertical alignment).  A popup
window appears where you can enter Latex source code.
<p>A <em>minipage</em> object is different from a simple text object in
that its width is part of its definition. When you create a minipage
object, you first have to drag out a horizontal segment for the
minipage.  This is used as the top edge of the minipage--it will
extend downwards as far as necessary to accomodate all the text.
Minipages are formatted using, not surprisingly, Latex's
<code>minipage</code> environment.  Latex tries to fill the given bounding
box as nicely as possible. It is possible to include center
environments, lemmas, and much more in minipages.
<p>To create a <em>textbox</em> object, simply press <font color="#0000ff">F10</font>.  Ipe
automatically places the object so that it spans the entire width of
the page (the <em>layout</em> settings in the stylesheet determine how
much space is left on the sides), and places it vertically underneath
the textboxes already on the page.  This is particularly convenient
for creating presentations with a lot of text, or with items that
appear <a href="manual_30.html">one by one</a>.
<p><em>Title</em> objects are managed by Ipe automatically.  They are
special labels that are created using <em>Edit title &#38; sections</em> in
the <em>Page</em> menu.  Their color, size, alignment, and position on
the page is determined by the stylesheet.
<p>You can use any LaTeX-command that is legal inside a
<code>\makebox</code> (for labels) or inside a <code>minipage</code> (for
minipages).  You cannot use commands that involve a non-linear
translation into PDF, such as commands to generate hyperlinks or to
include external images.
<p>You can use color in your text objects, using the <code>\textcolor</code>
command, like this:
<pre>
This is in black. \textcolor{red}{This is in red.} This is in black.
</pre>
All the symbolic colors of your current stylesheet are also available
as arguments to <code>\textcolor</code>.  You can also use absolute colors,
for instance:
<pre>
This is in black. \textcolor[rgb]{1,1,0}{This is in yellow.} This is in black.
</pre>
<p><a name="id1">

If</A> you need LaTeX-commands that are defined in additional LaTeX
packages, you can include (<code>\usepackage</code>) those in the LaTeX
preamble, which can be set in <em>Document properties</em> in the
<em>Edit</em> menu.
<p>After you have created or edited a text object, the Ipe screen display
will show the beginning of the Latex source.  You can select <em>Run
  Latex</em> from the <em>File</em> menu to create the PDF/Postscript
representation of the object.  This converts all the text objects in
your document at once, and Ipe will display a correct rendition of the
text afterwards.
<p>If the Latex conversion process results in errors, Ipe will
automatically show you the log file created by the Latex run.  If you
cannot figure out the problem, look in <a href="manual_36.html">the section on
  troubleshooting</a>.
<p>You can use Unicode text, such as accented characters, Greek,
Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, in your text objects, once
<a href="manual_38.html">you have set up the necessary style files and
  fonts</a>.
